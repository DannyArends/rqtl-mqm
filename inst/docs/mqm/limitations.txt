The current implementation of MQM has the following recognized limitations:
(1) MQM is limited to experimental crosses F2, RIL and BC.  (2) MQM
augmentation drops entire individuals from the equation when a lot of
marker data is missing.  (3) MQM does not treat sex chromosomes
differently from autosomal chromosomes - though one can introduce sex
as a cofactor. Finally, (4) automatic backward elimination sets
cofactors at fixed locations and ignores underlying known marker
density.  

Future versions of MQM may improve on these points. Check the
changelog for updates.
