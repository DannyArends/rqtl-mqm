At the moment, \mqm\ is limited to experimental crosses F2, RIL and BC.
Also \mqm\ does not treat sex chromosomes differently from autosomal
chromosomes - though one can introduce sex as a cofactor. Another
limitation is that \mqm\ handles one phenotype at a time. Finally,
automatic backward elimination currently does not consider the marker
density at locations. Future versions of \mqm\ may improve on this.
