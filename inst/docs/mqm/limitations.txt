At the moment, MQM is limited to experimental crosses F2, RIL and BC.
Also MQM does not treat sex chromosomes differently from autosomal
chromosomes - though one can introduce sex as a cofactor. Finally,
automatic backward elimination currently does not consider the marker
density at locations. Future versions of MQM may improve on this.
