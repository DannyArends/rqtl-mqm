MQM for R/qtl is based on the original implementation of multiple QTL
model (MQM) mapping and consists of a three step procedure: (1) data
augmentation, (2) automatic backward model elimination using genetic
markers as cofactors and (3) QTL (interval) mapping using the most
'informative' model. The method internally controls false discovery
rates (FDR) and lets users test different QTL models by elimation of
non-significant cofactors.  A genome scan is performed by moving a QTL
along the chromosomes while using a preselected set of markers as
cofactors. If the QTL gets close to a cofactor the cofactor gets
dropped. The backward elimination procedure starts with a
multiple-regression model on an augmented dataset, using a full set of
cofactors evenly spread over the genome. A maximum likelihood (ML)
approach is used for cofactor selection.
