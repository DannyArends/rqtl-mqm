Multiple QTL model (MQM) mapping is a powerful QTL mapping method
developed by Ritsert C. Jansen\cite{jansen94}.  MQM is an automatic
two-stage procedure in which, in the first stage, important markers
are selected in multiple regression on markers. In the second stage a
QTL is moved along the chromosomes by using the pre-selected markers
as cofactors, except for the markers flanking the interval under
study. A refined and automated procedure for cases with large numbers
of marker cofactors is included.

MQM for R/qtl (R/qtl-MQM) is based on the original implementation of
multiple QTL model (MQM) mapping and consists of a three step
procedure: (1) data augmentation, (2) automatic backward model
elimination using genetic markers evenly spread over the genome as
cofactors and (3) QTL (interval) mapping using the most 'informative'
model through maximum likelihood. The method internally controls false
discovery rates (FDR) and lets users test different QTL models by
elimation of non-significant cofactors.
