The theoretical framework of Multiple QTL Model (MQM) mapping was
introduced and explored by Ritsert Jansen \citep{Jansen:1993,
Jansen:1994a, Jansen:1994b}, explained in the Handbook of Statistical
Genetics \citep{Handbook:Jansen:2007} and used effectively in
practical research \citep{Schaar:1997, Jansen:1998, Bink:2002}, with
one known commercial implementation \citep{MapQTL}. Here we present
the first free and open source implementation of MQM. 

MQM is an automatic three-stage procedure in which, in the first
stage, missing data is 'augmented'. I.e. rather than guessing one
likely genotype, multiple genotypes are modeled with their matching
probabilities.  In the second stage important markers are selected in
multiple regression on markers. In the third stage a QTL is moved
along the chromosomes by using the pre-selected markers as cofactors,
except for the markers flanking the interval under study. QTL are
(interval) mapped using the most `informative' model through maximum
likelihood.  A refined and automated procedure for cases with large
numbers of marker cofactors is included.  The method internally
controls false discovery rates (FDR) and lets users test different QTL
models by elimation of non-significant cofactors.
