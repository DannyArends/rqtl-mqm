The current implementation of R/qtl-MQM has the following 
limitations: (1) MQM is limited to experimental crosses F2, RIL and
BC, (2) MQM augmentation drops entire individuals from the equation
when a lot of marker data is missing, (3) MQM does not treat sex
chromosomes differently from autosomal chromosomes - though one can
introduce sex as a cofactor. Finally, (4) automatic backward
elimination sets cofactors at fixed locations and ignores underlying
known marker density. Future versions of R/qtl-MQM may improve on
these points. Check the website and changelog for updates.
