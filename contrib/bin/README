This directory contains standalone binaries of R/qtl (currently MQM
implentations).

run:

  cd ./contrib/bin
  cmake .
	make 
	make test   
  (the binary is 'mqm').

(you will need the standard GNU gcc set, as well as cmake)

To run regression testing from the default R interpreter:

  rm CMakeCache.txt ; cmake -DTEST_R=TRUE 
  make testR

To test all

  make testall

Both build and install the 'R/qtl' package in its default location before
running the test scripts. You need both R and lapack, on Debian/Ubuntu:

  apt-get install r-base r-base-dev liblapack-dev
